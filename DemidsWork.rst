    One of the best experiences of this project was working in a team. This was a unique and 
    pleasant experience: all members of the group were passionate about the work they are doing.
    Furthermore, we had a friendly and supportive environment. Work in a group taught how to communicate 
    with people verbally and via web-services: GitHub and Slack. One of the first responsibilities
    assigned to me was the creation of the repository, markus group (submissions were my duty too) 
    and the skeleton of the project/code.
    
    I have created main functionality for the classes Player, Invader, InvadersGroup and Bullet by my self. After these classes were implemented, I put everything together in the Environment class to check that everything is working right. Unfortunately, I found a bug with invaders: some invaders were overlaying on top of each other at some point of the iteration; I did not fix the bug. After all code was done from my side, I did documentation for each class and its methods. 
    
    Last and not least, I cleared the code from unnecessary lines and variables and made the source look better. Additionallu, I did bug testing and some other additional tests to ensure that the game runs properly and does not freeze.
    
    Update:
        - Added health information to the player
        - Added sounds and music
        - Added win/lose scenario with animations
        - Looped the whole game play
        - Added exit button all screens
        - Added the colour change feature
        - Fixed the "insane" mode
        - Small fixes

    Last thoughts: this project was undone and I decided to finish it a little bit.
