    One of the best experiences of this project was working in a team. This was a unique and 
    pleasant experience: all members of the group were passionate about the work they are doing.
    Furthermore, we had a friendly and supportive environment. Work in a group taught how to communicate 
    with people verbally and via web-services such us GitHub and Slack. One of the first responsibilities
    assigned to me was the creation of the repository, markus group (submissions were my duty too) 
    and the skeleton of the project/code.
