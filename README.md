## A project for the course csc290.
#### Essential variables:
    ⋅⋅* screen_size = (int, int) -> (width, height)
    ⋅⋅* background = (int, int, int) -> colour of the background
    ⋅⋅* red = (255, 0, 0) -> RGB code for red colour to simplify work
    ⋅⋅* blue = (0, 0, 255) -> RGB code for blue colour to simplify work
    ⋅⋅* green = (0, 255, 0) -> RGB code for green colour to simplify work
    ⋅⋅* player_size = 30 -> the size of the player in int. Needed to track collisions and resize the sprite
    ⋅⋅* enemy_y_gap = 20 -> the gap between enemies in int. Needed to form a wel defined structure of groups enemies
