## Contributing
   This assignment was originally created for the purposes of a Computer Science Communications course, we tried our very        best to make sure it reaches professional standards but there is a possibility that it misses the mark.

### Future Contributers
   We know our code is not perfect, in fact it is very far from it. We hope that if you're reading this, you might be interested in being part of the process that betters our work. We encourage you to pull our repo and make changes you think can make Space Invaders: The Next Frontier even better :)

## A project for the course csc290.
#### Essential variables:
    ⋅⋅* screen_size = (int, int) -> (width, height)
    ⋅⋅* background = (int, int, int) -> colour of the background
    ⋅⋅* red = (255, 0, 0) -> RGB code for red colour to simplify work
    ⋅⋅* blue = (0, 0, 255) -> RGB code for blue colour to simplify work
    ⋅⋅* green = (0, 255, 0) -> RGB code for green colour to simplify work
    ⋅⋅* player_size = 30 -> the size of the player in int. Needed to track collisions and resize the sprite
    ⋅⋅* enemy_y_gap = 20 -> the gap between enemies in int. Needed to form a wel defined structure of groups enemies
