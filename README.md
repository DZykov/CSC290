## Game-play

This is a modern take on the classic game Space Invaders but with a few differences. First of all, the player has an 
option of choosing the colour of a ship. Secondly, enemies have different movement: first stage is moving from
left to right and vice-versa, while second stage is somewhat(pseudo) randomized and based on sin function. Thirdly,
enemies shoot randomly and allowed to have unlimited amount of bullets on a screen. Last and not least, the less enemies are on a
screen more they shoot.

## Contributing
   This assignment was originally created for the purposes of a Computer Science Communications course, we tried our very        best to make sure it reaches professional standards but there is a possibility that it misses the mark.

### Future Contributers
   We know our code is not perfect, in fact it is very far from it. We hope that if you're reading this, you might be interested in being part of the process that betters our work. We encourage you to pull our repo and make changes you think can make Space Invaders: The Next Frontier even better :)

## To-Do and Issues
   What we wish we completed and what other game players wish was implemented:
