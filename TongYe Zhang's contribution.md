------------------------------
    Working with my teammates was such a fun time, I have learned so much from each of them. Things like the use of sprites, graphic inporting and much more are new knwledge and experiences that I would not have encountered without their guide. I am so happy that I got to work with theses talented people.
    Coding wise, I have implimented the barrier and groupBarrier class, modified the enviorment class for barriers to move and die as intended.
    I have prepared the skeleton and many of the text for both representations, as well as the project plan's text.
