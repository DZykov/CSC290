    One of the main perks of being part of a group is the collaborative and
    supportive environment that comes with it. Working in a group like mine not
    only assisted me in improving my communication skills but it also means that
    I was able to learn how to help my group members. One of the first responsibilities
    assigned to me, was that of making sure my group members felt that they had a
    supportive environment. I would check up on the members of my team and make sure
    that they were on track with the schedule and if not, help them work through it.

    I also made sure that even if certain members were unable to attend our meetings
    they were later updated so that every person in our group was on the same page.
    In terms of programming, I was given the responsibility of the player class
    very early on. This required me to make sure all the player's methods worked
    as expected. After that I spent my time working on documentation and other areas
    that needed improvement. This included fixing code to be cleaner, adding functionality
    for the <asd> keys and even adding game_over() methods. The most difficult thing
    I had to work on for this game was implementing the wild move aspect of the game.

    When the player's health gets low the game automatically changes the movement
    of the invaders to go in a sine function movement (like a wave), this required
    a lot of math and learning how to implement math equations in pygame without running
    into unexpected errors. Finally, I worked on some last minute documentation and
    and ran tests to ensure that the game works.
